\title{Ancestral state reconstruction for a particular time}
\description{Infers marginal ancestral states based on a set of model parameters at a particular time}
\usage{
ancRECON_slice(corhmm.obj, time_slice, collapse=TRUE, ncores = 1)
}       
\arguments{
\item{corhmm.obj}{a corhmm object which is the output of the main corhmm function.}
\item{time_slice}{a vector of times to reconstruct (present = 0, root = max(branching.times(phy)))}
\item{collapse}{set collapse to be the same as it was during the corhmm run.}
\item{ncores}{number of cores to use during parallelization.}
}
\details{
This is a stand alone function for computing the marginal likelihoods at particular points along a branch for a given set of transition rates. ancRECON has the technical details of ancestral state reconstruction if you're interested. The time_slice argument will specify a time point where marginal reconstructions will be produced. You can imagine the time slice intersecting the branches of the phylogeny and doing a reconstruction there rather than at nodes as is typically done. 
}
\value{
a data.frame. Each row of time_slice is the time period that was specified. node is the closest tipward node to the slice on a particular branch. position is the amount of time (rootward) from the nearest node. Remaining columns are the marginal probabilities of each state at that particular node. There is also a plotting function that I don't currently export because it's unfinished. The example shows how to access it.
